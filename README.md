This is a bash script to restore a wordpress website similar to my restore_script repository. This script does everything in my restore_script repository and also adds ssl cert generation with letsencrypt/certbot. 

This script is set up with the --staging flag for issuing certificates. Remove this flag when you are ready to issue a certificate in prod. This is to prevent issues while testing. 

As always, any feedback is welcome and appreciated. Thank you!
